# Denoising
Image Denoising of Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) using RIDNet 

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of Image Denoising using the RIDNet (Residual in Residual Dense Network) architecture on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD). The goal is to reduce noise in smartphone-captured images and enhance overall image quality.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD), which is a widely used benchmark for evaluating denoising algorithms on smartphone-captured images. You can find more information about the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajat95gupta/smartphone-image-denoising-dataset 

# RIDNet
RIDNet is a deep learning architecture designed for image denoising tasks. It utilizes a Residual in Residual Dense Network to capture complex features and residual learning for efficient noise reduction. The model is trained on the SIDD dataset to learn the characteristics of smartphone image noise.
